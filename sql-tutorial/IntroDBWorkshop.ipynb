    "# Database Interaction with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 249 - The Python Database API Specification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) gives very specific instructions for how Python developers should interact with databases. Although there are some notable differences in the database backends, what that means is that from the Python perspective, the use of different databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc. should all be very similar. In this tutorial, we will go over the use of Python with SQLite - a lightweight and simple database that will immediately make the data management in your apps more effective."

    "The first thing to keep in mind is that we have to import _driver_ code - that is the API for the specific database that we want to use. The most common are:\n",

    "- [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)\n",
    "- [MySQL Connector/Python](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Though a host of other databases for vendors like IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle can be found at [Python Database Interfaces](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces). \n",
    "\n",

    "## Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you have to do is make a connection to a database. Often times this means you'll need the following information to connect to a database server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- hostname\n",
    "- port \n",
    "- username\n",
    "- password\n",
    "- database name\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is an _embedded_ database, however - which means it is stored in a file on disk, and operated on soley by a single program (not multiple programs at once). Therefore in order to create a connection to a SQLite database, we simply need to point it to a file on disk. "
