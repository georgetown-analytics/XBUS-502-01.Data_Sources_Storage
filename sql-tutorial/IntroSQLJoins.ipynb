    "There are a **lot** of superheroes in the Marvel Universe, and a **lot** of superhero movies, so we'll just be examining a small portion today. As you'll see, we are storing the information about the superheroes separately from the information about the superhero movies. In addition, since superheroes frequently use aliases rather than their real names, it makes sense that we might want to store those real names separately from their superhero personae. \n",
